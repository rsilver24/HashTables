        /** Test to see if hashCode as a whole works.
         *
         * The algorithm that calculates a key into a hash code is demonstrated by this procedure:
         *
         * s[0]*31^(n - 1) + s[1]*31^(n - 2) + ... + s[n - 1]    â€”    (read more in the readMe file)
         *
         * To test whether or not this works, given these 6 key values, I should be able to put and get the same key to get the same
         * value that has been inputed below. These following keys are what I've decided to use:
         * "Hey!", "How are you?", "but like... I don't want to go >:(", "157382", "!@#$%^&*()", and "A".
         *
         * These following values are what I've decided to use:
         * "Hi!", "I'm doing alright", "but you HAVE to go!", "wow those sure are numbers", "I don't really understand but yeah!", and "B".
         *
         * Additionally I have noticed that there must be a minimum HashTable capacity of 15 in order to avoid overlap. Given how I've done the calculations,
         * this is an understandable result given 6 different keys. Overlap is pretty bound to happen with a small capacity. Making
         * a capacity far larger would most definetly make this code so much more effective.
